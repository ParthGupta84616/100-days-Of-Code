Its the World Cup season and the Indian Squad is just smashing its opponent one after the other in a row making us invincible!! How can one forget the sensational half century of the centuries scored by the King of Cricket , the G.O.A.T - Virat Kohli. You are given an array of runs scored by the King in any number of overs throughout the match. Your task is to sort the runs in the array in ascending order by the number of 1's in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending order. Output the array of runs after sorting it.

Input Format

The first line will be T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase will give N the size of the array
The second line of each testcase will give array arr where arr[i] denotes the score of ith over.
Constraints

1<=T<=100

1 <= N <= 1000

0 <= arr[i] <= 1000000

Output Format

For each testcase output the sorted array

Sample Input 0

1
7
5 3 2 5 8 2 7
Sample Output 0

2 2 8 3 5 5 7

def count_set_bits(num):
    count = 0
    while num:
        count += num % 2
        num //= 2
    return count

def custom_sort(arr):
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (count_set_bits(x), x))

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        sorted_arr = custom_sort(arr)
        result = ' '.join(map(str, sorted_arr))
        print(result)
