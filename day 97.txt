You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Input Format

The first line will give T, the number of testcases.
Each testcase will give n.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= n <= 45
Output Format

For each testcase, print the number of distinct ways can you climb to the top.

Sample Input 0

1
2

Explanation 0

There are two ways to climb to the top.

1 step + 1 step
2 steps
Sample Input 1

3
Sample Output 1

3
Explanation 1

There are three ways to climb to the top.

1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 2 steps
2 steps + 1 step


def countDistinctWays(n):

    if n == 1:

        return 1

    elif n == 2:

        return 2

    else:

        dp = [0] * (n+1)

        dp[1] = 1

        dp[2] = 2

        for i in range(3, n+1):

            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

        return dp[n]


T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):

    n = int(input())

    result = countDistinctWays(n)

    print(result)
