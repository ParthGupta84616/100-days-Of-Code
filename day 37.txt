Given a binary array nums and an integer k, Print the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

Input Format

The first line will give T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase will give n, size of nums and k.
The second line of each testcase will give array nums.
Constraints

1<=T<=1000
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length
Output Format

Print the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.
