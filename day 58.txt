You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up 2 cups with different types of water, or 1 cup of any type of water.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array amount of length 3 where amount[0], amount[1], and amount[2] denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Print the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.

Input Format

The first line will give T, the number of testcases.
Each testcase will give an integer array amount of length 3 where amount[0], amount[1], and amount[2] denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
amount.length == 3
0 <= amount[i] <= 100
Output Format

For each testcase print the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.

One way to fill up the cups is:

Second 1: Fill up a cold cup and a warm cup.
Second 2: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
Second 3: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup.
It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of seconds needed.
