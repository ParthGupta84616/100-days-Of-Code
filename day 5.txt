Ram is celebrating Diwali with his family and friends. He has a box of firecrackers that contains different types of firecrackers, such as rockets, chakris, anaars, and phuljharis. Each firecracker has a number written on it, which represents its loudness level. The loudness level of each firecracker is given in the form of an array L of N positive integers.

He also has an array of auspicious numbers A of M numbers that are considered lucky for Diwali. The luckiness score of an auspicious number is the number of firecrackers in the box that have a loudness level divisible by that auspicious number.

Your task is to print the auspicious number with the maximum luckiness score. If there is more than one auspicious number with the maximum score, print the minimum of them.

Input Format

The first line gives T, the number of testcases
The first line of each testcase denotes N and M.
The second line of each testcase will give array L where L[i] denotes the loudness of ith cracker.
The third line of each testcase will give array A where A[i] is the ith auspicious number.
Constraints

1<=T<=500
1<=M<=1000
1<=N<=1000
1<=L[i]<=100,000
1<=A[i]<=100,000
Output Format

For each testcase print the auspicious number with the maximum luckiness score. If there is more than one auspicious number with the maximum score, print the minimum of them.

Sample Input 0

1
5 3
4 7 9 3 9
5 2 3
Sample Output 0

3
Explanation 0

The luckiness score for every auspicious number in divisors is:
The luckiness score of A[0] is 0 since no number in L is divisible by 5.
The luckiness score of A[1] is 1 since L[0] is divisible by 2.
The luckiness score of A[2] is 3 since L[2], L[3], and L[4] are divisible by 3.
Since A[2] has the maximum divisibility score, we return it.
