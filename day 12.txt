Reena and Meena are playing an interesting game. They start from specific coordinates and take turns giving each other directions. Reena starts at point (x, y), and they follow a series of directions given by instructions through a string s, the instructions are as follows : -

There are following symbols in the String
N - North direction
S - South direction
E - East direction
W - West direction
The integers followed by the above symbols in the string signify the distance to be covered in the direction mentioned through the symbols (N,S,E,W).
Your task is to calculate the Euclidean distance from the origin (0,0) to their final position after following the directions.

Input Format

The first line will give T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase will give x and y, the initial coordinates.
The second line of each testcase will be string s, giving the instructions.
Constraints

1<=T<=1000
-100,000<=x,y<=100,000
s only contains numbers, and some alphabets (capital N,E,W,S).
1<=s.length()<=1000
Output Format

For each testcase, output the Euclidean distance from the origin (0,0) to the final position with a precision of 2 decimal places.For example if distance is 1.41421 then output 1.41 and if distance is 4 then output 4.00

Sample Input 0

3 4
N2E3S6
Sample Output 0

6.00
Explanation 0

here, initial coordinates x=3, y=4. now first they went north 2 units therefore now coordinates (3,6), now east 3 units coordinates= (6,6), and finally south 6 units so coordinates=(6,0). Now distance from origin = ((6*6)+(0*0))^1/2 = 6 units therefore output is 6.00
