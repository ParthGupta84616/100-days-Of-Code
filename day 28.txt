Mikasa and Eren are observing a galaxy cluster. There are N stars in the cluster where the i th star has a spectral type of S[i].

Mikasa decides to record some of these N stars in her telescope. Eren decides that he will record all the stars left in the cluster after Mikasa has finished.

Find out whether it is possible that Mikasa and Eren end up with exactly same multiset of spectral types.

Input Format

The first line will give T, the number of Testcases.
The first line of each testcase will give N, the number of stars in the cluster.
The second line will give the array S.
Constraints

1<=T<=1000
1<=N<=10000
1<=S[i]<=10000
Output Format

For each testcase, print yes if it is possible that Mikasa and Eren end up with exactly same multiset of spectral types else print no
