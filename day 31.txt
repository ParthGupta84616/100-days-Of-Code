nosuke and Zenitsu are playing a game. They are given two strings a and b. Inosuke would win if a is a subsequence of b and if its not then Zenitsu would win. Write a program that outputs the winner of game.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Input Format

The first line will give T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase will give a.
The second line of each testcase will give b.
Constraints

1<=T<=1000
a.length <=10000
b.length <=10000
Output Format

For each testcase print "Inosuke" if Inosuke is the winner, print "Zenitsu" otherwise.
