You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers arr.

The interval between two elements in arr is defined as the absolute difference between their indices. More formally, the interval between arr[i] and arr[j] is |i - j|.

Print an array intervals of length n where intervals[i] is the sum of intervals between arr[i] and each element in arr with the same value as arr[i].

Note: |x| is the absolute value of x.

Input Format

The first line will give T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase will give n, the number of elemts in arr.
The second line of each testcase will give array arr.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
n == arr.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
Output Format

For each testcase, print an array intervals of length n where intervals[i] is the sum of intervals between arr[i] and each element in arr with the same value as arr[i].

2 1 3 1 2 3 3
Sample Output 0

4 2 7 2 4 4 5
Explanation 0

Index 0: Another 2 is found at index 4. |0 - 4| = 4
Index 1: Another 1 is found at index 3. |1 - 3| = 2
Index 2: Two more 3s are found at indices 5 and 6. |2 - 5| + |2 - 6| = 7
Index 3: Another 1 is found at index 1. |3 - 1| = 2
Index 4: Another 2 is found at index 0. |4 - 0| = 4
Index 5: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 6. |5 - 2| + |5 - 6| = 4
Index 6: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 5. |6 - 2| + |6 - 5| = 5
Sample Input 1

10 5 10 10
Sample Output 1

5 0 3 4
Explanation 1

Index 0: Two more 10s are found at indices 2 and 3. |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5
Index 1: There is only one 5 in the array, so its sum of intervals to identical elements is 0.
Index 2: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 3. |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3
Index 3: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 2. |3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4
