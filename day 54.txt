Raju and Chutki are playing a game. There are two piles numbered 1 and 2. Pile 1 contains X stones while Pile 2 contains Y stones.

Raju starts the game.

In his turn, Raju can either remove 1 stone each from both the piles or remove 2 stones from pile 1.
On the other hand, Chutki, in her turn, can either remove 1 stone each from both the piles or remove 2 stones from pile 2.
The player who cannot make a move loses. Determine the winner if both players play optimally.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers X and Y, the initial number of stones in piles 1 and 2 respectively.
Constraints

1<=T<=1000
1<=X,Y<=10^9
Output Format

For each test case, output Raju if Raju wins the game, and Chutki otherwise.

Raju
Explanation 0

Test case 1: Consider the following sequence of moves:

Raju removes 1 stone each from both the piles. Thus, pile 1 has no stone left while pile 2 has 9 stones left.
Chutki removes 2 stones from pile 2. Thus, pile 1 has no stones left while pile 2 has 7 stones left.
Since Raju has no valid move, he loses. Note that this might not be an optimal sequence of moves.

Test case 2: Consider the following sequence of moves:

Raju removes 1 stone each from both the piles. Thus, pile 1 has 1 stone left and pile 2 has 1 stone left.
Chutki removes 1 stone each from both the piles. Thus, pile 1 has no stones left and pile 2 has no stones left.
Since Raju has no valid move, he loses. Note that this might not be an optimal sequence of moves.
