Ram and Priya are playing an amazing game where they take turns and give each other a name. They have to reverse the name given by them to each other from a particular position and speak aloud the new reversed word. Write a program to help them reverse the name.

Input Format

Take T test cases as the input.
First line of input under each test case should be K, the position to which the String has to be reversed.
Second line of the input should be the String S.
Constraints

1<=T<=1000
1<=S.size()<=1000
0<=K<=S.size()
Output Format

Print the new reversed String for each testcase.
Sample Input 0

2
3
captain
4
tonystark
Sample Output 0

pactain
ynotstark
Explanation 0

Input String - captain
reverse from position - 3
We will reverse the string till the character at position 3 i.e. “p” ; the output will be “pactain”
Similarly,
Input String - tonystark
reverse till position - 4
Output-ynotstark

total_cases=int(input())
def game():
    position=int(input())
    name=input()
    to_reverse=name[:position]
    sec_half=name[position:]
    reverse=to_reverse[::-1]
    return reverse+sec_half

for cases in range(total_cases):
    print(game())
